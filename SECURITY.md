# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Found a bug? Oh no! But also, yay! You're making `google-cloud-github-runner` better.

If you've stumbled upon a security vulnerability, please do not open a public issue. I don't want the bad guys to know before I fix it, right?

Instead, please report it privately. You can reach out to me directly via email.

**Please email: `nils [at] nkn-it (dot) de`**

## What you get

- **Fame**: Your name in my heart (and maybe a shoutout in the release notes).
- **Glory**: The knowledge that you saved the day.
- **Money**: ...is not something I have. But you get infinite internet points!

I promise to take your report seriously and fix it faster than you can say "Zero Day".
